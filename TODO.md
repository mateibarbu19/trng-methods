Programming:

- ensure 16 bit data
- ensure only mono
- default params
- entropy from scipy.stats import entropy?
- rng-test of WAV
- NIST test of WAV

Methods:
- correcting bias + correlation
- resampling of ogg
- fm record

Miscellaneous:
- extract most entropic data from low entropy file
- determine how much of file can be used

Add capture:
- random
- cmb
